# Implementation of the Sing a Song Kata

This kata is to practice TDD techniques. I am not completely happy with my loops in the explanatoryVerses() methods, but I will leave it as is for now. As an exercise for later, perhaps they could be reworked in a more functional style.

The code uses:
* Java 8
* Maven
* JUnit 4.12 / Hamcrest 2.0.0.0

## The “Situation”

Code to produce a popular children’s nursery rhyme was produced by a web agency for the customer 
last year. The customer now desires to produce multiple different versions of the song using the 
same structure but based on different themes, for example a current popular children’s movie 
featuring a cast of animals. The customer asks that you make the song configurable for different 
lists of animals. The customer cannot guarantee that there will be the same number of animals in 
each different version.

No documentation or tests were provided by the previous developer.

## Your Task

Refactor the code to allow for the customer’s needs. Remember: refactoring can only be done in
the presence of tests that are passing, and after refactoring the tests still pass!
